In constant movement, even if I can't move well, in constant learning, I don't lose the illusion of accepting new challenges and projects, even if sometimes I don't have the energy. Expression, communication, with or without words, even if I don't understand it.

Learning. Learning. Learning.

The line, the dot, the typography, the colours, the movement, the stillness. I am still curious to understand these mysteries and to handle them like a still juggler. The highest frequency of movement is stillness.

In continuous renewal like life. Adapting to new circumstances, to my new form, my own care. Reclaiming my own form and rhythm, because having stuck to others brought me not growth but frustration and pain. Freedom is the best cure.

It has been a gift to work and learn with the best, even though my health did not allow me to reach my zenith, so I have to do it in those other ways that are now possible, with the imprint that each one has left on me.

Designing is making life easier, creativity is solving problems. Reinventing oneself. Redesigning oneself. Everything in its own time with its own timing.

New ways of working. New ways to build. New paths to find. New turning points. New channels of expression and communication. Subtle, small, shrewd.

Devising projects. Wishing to collaborate in yours. Wishing you to collaborate in mine.

Let's have a coffee and see what we do?

Energy is all I need.
